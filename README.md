Hello Guys, I'm Mahyar 😀 I produce content in the field of network and operating system 👨‍🏫 I do programming in my free time (mostly with Python and Bash) 👨‍💻 I am very interested in open source things 🌐 I am learning and interested in information security and becoming a white hacker 🐱‍💻 Reading books and walking in nature, mountains and deserts are also my personal interests 😎

# Field of activity
I **recently** joined Github, so my first goal is to **participate** in various projects, **improve** them, **debug** and **report**. I will continue this goal until **2023**.
I **declare** my **readiness** to **participate** in any open source project. You can contact me through communication channels (email, GitHub, etc.). It would be my honor to **volunteer to collaborate** on your open source projects.
